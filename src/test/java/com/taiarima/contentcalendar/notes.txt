Boundary Tests: Check the behavior with the edge cases of your business rules (e.g., maximum allowed content, minimum required fields).

Validation Tests: If there are validation annotations in your entity, you should test that these are triggered as expected (e.g., trying to save a Content with no title).

Search Functionality: If your application provides search functionality on multiple fields, you might want to test those search queries.

Custom Queries: Any custom repository methods should have corresponding tests, especially if they involve complex queries or multiple table joins.

Concurrent Access: If applicable, test how your repository behaves under concurrent access. This might not be relevant if your application doesn't require concurrent transactions.

Transactional Behavior: Test that transactional boundaries are respected (e.g., nothing is saved to the database if part of a transaction fails).

Cascade Operations: If there are cascade operations (like CascadeType.REMOVE or CascadeType.ALL), ensure that they are functioning as expected when you perform operations on the parent entity.

Lazy vs. Eager Loading: If you're using lazy or eager fetching strategies, write tests to ensure that the associated entities are loaded as expected.

Integration Tests: Besides unit tests, integration tests that run against an actual database instance can help catch configuration and interaction issues that unit tests might miss.

Exception Handling: Test how your repository handles exceptions, such as database constraints violations or query timeouts.

Performance Tests: Though not typical for a repository test suite, you might want to have some performance tests if certain queries are critical and potentially slow.

Profile-Specific Behavior: If your application uses different Spring profiles that might alter the repository behavior, you should test those profiles.
